Earlier, I was listening to the The Deutsch Files I and came across this beautiful insight by David Deutsch.

>*“…if you invest all your hopes in getting that gold medal, getting to be world number one, then you won’t be happy even when you are world number one, let alone if you aren’t. If you aren’t, you will always be the failure that you hoped you wouldn’t be. And if you are, you’ll find that it’s empty...and I don’t know who has it worse, the ones that fail or the ones that succeed. I think maybe a lot of people just need inspiration and once they’ve got that they do the right thing anyway, even if the ideology they’re following isn’t that. They’re just doing the right thing anyway. Like Newton thought he was doing induction and he never did any induction. But he was inspired by that idea. And therefore interpreted his own behavior as being that when it wasn’t anything like that.”*

At first this reminded me of the importance of being authentically curious towards what you do and how you live. 

But then I thought, if I put authenticity and curiosity first, over reaching what I call ‘success’, will I ever become the person who I’d like to be or contribute to the world at the level I want to impact it?

But then, I realized, I don’t think ambition negates authenticity / curiosity (vice versa). You can be authentically ambitious. The reason authenticity / curiosity might seem counterproductive for success at times is because it’s volatile, prone to change. But I think this is just us redefining what we do until we find what we’re meant to do. What’s important is having the conviction & ambition to do deep into what you’re authentically curious about.

I think on the long term, say decades, if you’re ambitious enough to go super deep towards what you’re authentically curious about, you’d find what you’re meant to do, and eventually reach what you call ‘success’. And your probability for say, positively impacting the world at scale, will be greater if you remain authentically curious because you’ll be driven to have the conviction / ambition to go deep.

Ironically, it might not be optimal to put success first if you want success.
