A Vanilla Neural Network, trained to classify digits in the MNIST dataset, built on pure NumPy.

The motivation for this project was to establish foundational knowledge in deep learning in regards to the mathematics and programming.

Check out a quick visual of the model as it's fed data and trained, right **[here](https://x.com/vxnuaj/status/1772016098159866229?s=20)¹**.

**ChangeLog:**

**03/24/24**: 

[1] Decided to revisit this project and hack together a visualization of the params, both whilst training and testing, just out of curiosity.
