This project was part of a 2 day hackathon sprint, to build a solution to a world problem using emerging tech.

Our team focused on the inefficiencies of the Indian Railway to effectively transport coal, which led to critically low coal levels and a lack of electricity for homes, education facilities, transportation, and hospitals, to a final loss of $24.24 million.

After looking at the financial incentives and systematic issues, we proposed using a combination of the A* search algorithm, decision trees, and a Deep-Q-Network to compute the optimal route for coal transportation.
