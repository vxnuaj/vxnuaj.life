Our team got the opportunity to ideate a moonshot solution to [late lung cancer diagnosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5338577/).

**The Problem**: Late lung cancer diagnosis leads to 1,073,682 deaths per year contributing to a global death count of 1,796,144.

We designed Synthexia, a moonshot company that aims enhance lung cancer diagnostics using *[CRISPR-CAS12a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cas12a)*.

Our project was pitched to Paul Needham (CEO @ Arca), Praveen (ex Tesla/Facebook), and Samira Khan (@ Microsoft).
